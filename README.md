## General info
This is my first JavaScript project, if you have any suggestions or thoughts I would gladly appreciate if you could contact me on here or on discord with the suggestion! This is my version of re-creating a nopixel tracker hack.
	
## How does it work?
Basically, you get a list of random letters in which you need to find the combination which is displayed above the said random letters. The current chosen combination is marked in red color, you use either the arrow keys or WASD keys to move fields. When you've found the required combination, you press enter to confirm, after which the 'window' closes and the sequence gets accepted of course if the marked letters are the same as the combination. You can switch between symbols(Greek letters), numbers or letters in the top left corner.
